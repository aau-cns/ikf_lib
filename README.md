Find the lib impementation in `source/ikf` and the test directory in `source/tests/ikf-test`.
Find a commandline example tool in `source/examples/ikf_cmd`.


## build project

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DOPTION_BUILD_EXAMPLE=ON -DOPTION_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DOPTION_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make all test
```

## run examples

Example is based on constant accelation moving body model in 1D (see https://www.kalmanfilter.net/modeling.html). The body is moving in a harmonic way and the filter obtains as control input  noisy acceleration measurements for the state propagation. The filter is corrected via noisy position updates and relative position updates between bodies.   

### ikf_simple_cmd

Naive implementation of the IKF, without supporting delayed measurements (no buffering). 

```
build$ ./ikf_simple_cmd
```

### ikf_delay_cmd

Implementation of the IKF supporting delayed measurements.

```
build$ ./ikf_dealy_cmd
```
